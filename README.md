**SKYSTONE_CV**. 

THIS DETECTOR RETURNS THE PIXEL LOCATION OF THE LEFT MOST BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK TARGET. 
YOU CAN EASILY MODIFY IT TO GET YOU THE CENTER. 
IT IS YOUR JOB TO DETERMINE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO BASED ON THIS VALUE. 

SOMETIMES THERE IS SOME RANDOM CRASH THAT HAPPENS IF UR CAMERA WOBBLES A LOT
I AM LOOKING INTO A FIX, BUT AS LONG AS UR CAMERA DOESN"T FLAIL WILDLY IN MATCH U R GOOD. 

IF YOU SEE BUGS PLEASE MESSAGE ME ON DISCORD at Epsilon#0036. 
THIS IS BY NO MEANS ROBUST, BUT IT WORKS WELL FOR ME. 

THIS DETECTOR SACRIFICES SPEED FOR A LOT OF VERSATILITY AS
IT FUNCTIONS WITH LOTS OF NOISE BY PERFORMING LOTS OF FILTERS. 
IF YOU FEEL THAT SOME PARTS OF THIS PIPELINE ARENT NEEDED, THEN REMOVE THEM
TO IMPROVE FRAMERATE. 

If possible, feed this pipeline into easy open cv to get a slightly better framerate. I was getting weird errors with eocv so I used vuforia to get frames instead, but it seems to work in most configurations.
